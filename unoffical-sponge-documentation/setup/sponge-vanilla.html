            <h3>Quick start guide</h3>
            <p>This is a step by step reference on how to create a Minecraft server with Sponge Vanilla version 7 and
                above</p>
            <div class="insert note">
                <span>Note</span>
                <p>If you are migrating from a CraftBukkit based server (Spigot, Paper, PurPur, etc)
                    then there are extra steps for transfering your world over. Please read <a
                        href="https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/server/getting-started/migrating.html">Migrating
                        to Sponge</a> as it explains the process</p>
            </div>
            <h4>System requirements</h4>
            <p>Sponge has the same system requirements as the vanilla minecraft server. It is however recommended to
                have more RAM and better single core performace.</p>
            <div class="insert note">
                <span>Note</span>
                <p>It is recommended to use the minimum LTS (Long Term Supported) version java that your version of
                    minecraft supports where possible as that is also what plugins are designed to target. This is
                    not a golden rule however and some plugins may require newer versions of Java</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insert warning">
                <span>Warning</span>
                <p>Sponge may not work on newer versions of Java that were released after it</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Getting started</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Download <a href="https://spongepowered.org/downloads/spongevanilla">Sponge Vanilla</a> on the
                    chosen
                    version
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place downloaded SpongeVanilla in empty folder
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run Sponge Vanilla (see below on how to run)
                </li>
                <li>
                    (Optional) Modify server.properies
                </li>
                <li>
                    (Optional) Place sponge plugins into the <span class="special">mods</span> folder
                </li>
                <li>
                    Read and accept the minecraft eula
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run again
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>How to run</h4>
            <p>Sponge vanilla does not have a graphical interface for when the server is running, instead that is
                disabled due to performace. To run SpongeVanilla will depend on your computer, in paticular your
                operating system. If you don't know your operating system assume it to be Windows</p>

            <h4>How to run on Windows</h4>
            <p>Windows is actually the simpliest to run, whereby all that is needed is a <span
                    class="special">run.bat</span> script.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Rename the sponge vanilla file to <span class="special">sponge</span></li>
                <li>Open <span class="special">notepad</span> application</li>
                <li>Paste the code below into notepad</li>
                <li>Save the file into the folder where sponge is with the type as <span class="special">All types
                        (*.*)</span> and ensure that the name given is <span class="special">run.bat</span></li>
                <li>To run the server, double click the <span class="special">run</span> file</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="insert code"><span>run.bat</span><code>java -jar ./sponge.jar --nogui</code></div>

            <h4>How to run on Mac-os / Linux</h4>
            <p>The Mac-os and Linux operating systems come with a program called <span class="special">Bash</span> that
                we will use to launch SpongeVanilla with.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Rename the sponge vanilla file to <span class="special">sponge.jar</span></li>
                <li>Open <span class="special">TextEdit</span> (Mac), <span class="special">Kate</span> (KDE Linux) or
                    <span class="special">Text Editor</span> (Gnome Linux) application
                </li>
                <li>Paste the code below into the application</li>
                <li>Save the file into the folder where sponge is with the name <span class="special">run.sh</span></li>
                <li>Open the <span class="special">Terminal</span> application</li>
                <li>type <span class="special">cd </span> and then paste in the path to the folder you have your Sponge
                    file in</li>
                <li>press the Enter key</li>
                <li>On Mac-os type <span class="special">chmod +755 run.sh</span> or on Linux type <span
                        class="special">chmod +x run.sh</span></li>
                <li>Press the Enter key</li>
                <li>You can now right click the <span class="special">run.sh</span> file and then select <span
                        class="special">Run with terminal</span></li>
            </ol>
            <div class="insert code"><span>run.sh</span><code>#!/usr/bin/env sh</code><code>
