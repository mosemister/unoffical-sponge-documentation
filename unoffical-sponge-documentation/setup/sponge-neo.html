            <h3>Quick start guide</h3>
            <p>This is a step by step reference on how to create a Minecraft server with Sponge Neo version 12 and
                above</p>

                <span>Note</span>
                <p>If you are migrating from a CraftBukkit based server (Spigot, Paper, PurPur, etc)
                    then there are extra steps for transfering your world over. Please read <a
                        href="https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/server/getting-started/migrating.html">Migrating
                        to Sponge</a> as it explains the process</p>
            </div>
            <h4>System requirements</h4>
            <p>Sponge has the same system requirements as the vanilla minecraft server. It is however recommended to
                have more RAM and better single core performace.</p>
            <div class="insert note">
                <span>Note</span>
                <p>It is recommended to use the minimum LTS (Long Term Supported) version java that your version of
                    minecraft supports where possible as that is also what plugins are designed to target. This is
                    not a golden rule however and some plugins may require newer versions of Java</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insert warning">
                <span>Warning</span>
                <p>Sponge and/or NeoForge may not work on newer versions of Java that were released after it</p>
